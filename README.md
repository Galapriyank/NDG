# Problem Definition
Every developing and underdeveloped Nation face poverty and poverty leads to unemployment, lack of basic facilities like health and education. For the coming generations with changing times its more crucial for them to receive both health and education as technology advancement is reaching its peak and its time, we get rid of these basic issues on a global level. Recent estimates for global poverty are that 8.6 percent of the world, or 736 million people, live in extreme poverty on $1.90 or less a day, according to the World Bank. Due to this underprivileged kids are still devoid of primary education and more than 6 million die/suffer due to the lack of proper treatment, medicines and nutrition. 
In this project, we are creating an application that will forge strategic partnerships between Companies, Hospitals and NGO’s where the employees of the respective organizations will be able address the issues stated above increasing the Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) of their company and it will also play a key role during their overall development. 


# Functionalities

In order to solve this critical problem, we have created a Model that will facilitate communication between 4 enterprises that are in the Network namely : NGO’s, Corporate’s, Grocery Company's and Private Hospital’s. The NGO will have underprivileges kids who seek skill development, food and health treatment. They will create events like educational sessions,  and health checkups and sent them respectively to the Corporate’s and Hospital’s organization.
2. The Corporate employees will take part in this initiative since it will help the company’s CSR score and play a huge role during their appraisal period. The Doctors will join this initiative to execute their knowledge in helping the underprivileged kids who will be relieved from all the diseases they have had. 
3. In the end, the students will be given a test after the Education Workshop to check what they learnt, and a prescription after their Health Checkup to help them in restoring their wellbeing.
